    Harvey Reginald Specter, J.D. is a former corporate attorney, one of the
    name partners at Specter Litt Wheeler Williams, the managing partner of
    Specter Litt, and a former Assistant District Attorney for the New York
    County District Attorney's Office. He is also the husband of Donna Paulsen.
    <br />
    <br />
    After being promoted to the position of senior partner at Pearson Hardman in
    2011, he hired Mike Ross, a veritable genius with a photographic memory who
    was able to pass the bar exam despite not attending law school, as his
    associate.<br /><br />
    <b>History</b><br /><br />
    Harvey grew up in Riverside, New York. Harvey was 16 when he first caught
    his mother, Lily Specter, cheating on his father, Gordon Specter. Not
    wanting to hurt his father's feelings, Harvey did not tell him about it and
    watched his mother's indiscretions in silence for the next two years.
    Eventually, she left them. Jessica Pearson met Harvey while he was still
    working in the mailroom of Gordon Schmidt Van Dyke. Harvey had realized that
    an associate backdated a postage when he missed a filing, so he came into
    Jessica's office and told her that if the firm did not declare misconduct,
    he would report them to the D.A. Impressed, Jessica soon paid for Harvey to
    go to Harvard Law, where he "jerked off the entire time [he was] there". He
    also met Dana Scott, a rival at law and occasional lover.
    <br /><br />
    After graduating 5th in his class from Harvard Law, Jessica wanted him to
    gain "trial experience", so she recommended that he work as an assistant for
    New York District Attorney Cameron Dennis, saying that "Cameron was the only
    one he should learn from." Harvey worked as an Assistant District Attorney
    under Cameron for the next 2 years. This is where he met Donna Paulsen, who
    became his secretary. After catching Cameron burying evidence on his cases,
    Harvey decided to leave the District Attorney's office to work at Pearson
    Hardman, with Donna following right behind him. Entering Pearson Hardman as
    a "sophomore" associate, he soon went up the ranks and became a senior
    associate. While there, he meets Zoe Lawford, a fellow associate Harvey
    shared a mutual attraction with.
    <br /><br />
    In 2007, Jessica approaches Harvey to find out who is embezzling money from
    the firm. Initially suspecting junior partner and colleague Louis Litt, they
    later realize that it is actually the managing partner, Daniel Hardman.
    Through Donna, he and Jessica find out that Daniel had been stealing from
    the company for his extramarital affair with Monica Eton, so they blackmail
    him into surrendering his seat at the firm to Jessica. Because of his deal
    with Jessica, Harvey is then promoted to junior partner. His father, Gordon
    Specter, who had long been rooting for him to be promoted, dies of a heart
    attack. He has been visiting his grave occasionally since then, symbolically
    sharing drinks with him.
